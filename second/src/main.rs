// Functions

// Functions are declared using the 'fn' keyword.

fn main() {
    hello_world(); // Function Call
}

// Naming convention for functions is tha same as variables, we can't have somethin like numbers at the start or keywords as function names
fn hello_world () {
    println!("Hello World [From Function]!");
}
